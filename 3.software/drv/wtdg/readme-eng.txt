This module supports three loading paramaters£∫default_margin°¢nodeamon”Înowayout. Their means are as followed:
	(1) default_margin£∫the timmer margin(in second) for watchdog to release an interrupt signal. Its default value is 60. It should not less than 0, and it will be set to 60 when it is 0.
	(2) nodeamon£∫this value decides whether to create a kernel thread to feed the watchdog automatically. A kernel thread to feed the watchdog is created when it is 0, or there is no thread to be created. Its default value is 0. No matter what value this member is, when a process opens the watchdog device file successfully, it should feed the watchdog, or a reset signal will be sended to the system after 2 timer interrupt.
    (3) nowayout: this value decides whether to allow unload the module when a process has closed the watchdog device file. It doesn't allow to unload when it is not 0. When it is not 0 and a process open the device file, a reset signal will be sended to the system after 2 timer interrupt if the process doesn't feed it. It allows to unload when it is 0. when it is 0 and there is no other process open the device file after one close it, if nodeamon is 0, the kernel thread will feed the watchdog automatically. Its default value is 0. It can be changed by write it. If you write a string contained 'V', its value will be set to 1; if the string doesn't contain 'V', its value will be set to 0.
